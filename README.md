# dofus-switcher
Scripts for managing Dofus windows when multiboxing.

This is a simple repository for holding some utility scripts I've been working on for Dofus.

Among them are (currently):
- `x11_switcher.py`, a script for switching between Dofus windows while using the X11 Window System.

I want to rebuild `x11_switcher.py` for Wayland, as I plan to switch to that in the not-too-distant future now that explicit sync drivers are available.
